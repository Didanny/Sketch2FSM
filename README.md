# Sketch2FSM

## How to build
### The C++ files
To build the cpp files you will first need to download OpenCV, the version I'm using here is 3.4.1 which can be downloaded from [here](https://opencv.org/releases.html).

You will need to add `opencv\build\include` to the include directories and `opencv\build\x64\vc14\lib`to the library directories with library name `opencv_world341d.lib`. Also to run `opencv_world341d.dll` will need to be in the directory of the executable or add `opencv\build\x64\vc14\bin` to the PATH environment variable on your device.

You will also need Tesseract-OCR for the character recognition. For convenience I've included Tesseract-OCR with the English model in my submission repository. The program will run without tesseract, it will just label all the characters as `"unknown"`.

To install see [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract). For an easy windows installation see [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).

### The C# Files
The GUI was made using Microsoft's .NET Desktop Development Workload on VS 2017 with C# and WPF. So to build it you will need the C# compiler that comes with the .NET Framework.

The GUI starts the executable generated from the C++ code. In `C#\Sketch2FSM_UI\MainWindow.xaml.cs` go to line 70 and change the `FilePath` variable to the the path of the executable generated by the C++ code.

You will also need to add `opencv_world341d.dll` to the directory of this executable.
